Mini SQL Project

Student Course Management System

  This repository contains a small-scale SQL project designed to demonstrate the core concepts of relational database design and basic SQL operations. The project models a student course management system, featuring students, courses, instructors, and enrollments.

It's perfect for beginners who are learning SQL and want a practical, hands-on example of how database tables relate and interact with each other.

~Project Features~

Schema Design: 

Includes creation of normalized tables:

-students
-courses
-instructors
-enrollments

-Relationships:
  Uses primary and foreign keys to establish relationships between entities.

-Data Insertion:
  Populated with sample data to make testing and query practice easier.

-Basic Queries:
  Demonstrates inner joins and select queries to fetch combined data from multiple tables.
